odf-fetch
=========

Incredibly hackish, one-off piece of middleware to mediate between the official olympic data feed (ODF) and a client's Ventuz-backed installation. Used at the Winter Olympics of 2014 in Sochi, and unlikely to be used for anything else.

SFTP passwords intentionally left in the script, since the servers hosting the accounts are long gone.
